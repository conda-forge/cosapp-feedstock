  summary: CoSApp, the Collaborative System Approach.
  description: |
    The primary goal of **CoSApp** is to help technical departments in the design of complex systems.
    To do so, the framework allows the simulation of various systems representing the different parts
    of the final product in a common environment. The benefit is the ability for each subsystem team
    to carry out design study with a direct feedback at product level.

    The main features are:

    - Butterfly effect

    Couple your simulation models with CoSApp to get immediate impact on main product variables
    and iterate to converge on a better design.

    - Design guidance

    All systems can share design parameters associated with an acceptable range. You can take advantage
    of those limited degrees of freedom without fear of breaking your collaborators' work.

    - Flexible simulation workflows

    CoSApp solvers can be combined into versatile, customized workflows that fit specific simulation intents.
